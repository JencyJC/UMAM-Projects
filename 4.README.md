# 🎬 Netflix Data Analysis & Visualization Project

This project explores Netflix's content catalog to uncover trends in content type, ratings, genres, and time-based additions. Using Python and Power BI, the project analyzes patterns across thousands of movies and shows from 1925 to 2021 to derive meaningful insights and present them through visual dashboards.
