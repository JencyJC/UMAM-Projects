# 🛒 E-commerce Furniture Sales Prediction (2024)

This project analyzes and predicts furniture item sales on an e-commerce platform using a dataset scraped from AliExpress. It employs two machine learning models—Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor—to forecast the number of items sold based on price, shipping method, and product tags.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To build and evaluate regression models that can predict the number of units sold (`sold`) for furniture products based on:

- Current price
- Shipping type
- Product pricing categories

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- **Source**: AliExpress (via Apify scraper)
- **Records**: 2,000
- **Columns**:
  - `productTitle`: Name of the product
  - `price`: Selling price in USD
  - `sold`: Number of units sold
  - `tagText`: Shipping information (e.g., Free shipping)

---

## 📊 Workflow

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Removed missing values and irrelevant columns (`originalPrice`)
- Converted `price` to float
- Normalized `tagText` to simplify categorical encoding

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Added a `price_range` feature (Low, Medium, High, Very High)
- Label encoded shipping tags and price ranges

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution plots for `price` and `sold`
- Correlation heatmap
- Feature importance chart using Random Forest

### 4. Model Building
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

### 5. Model Evaluation
- **Metrics Used**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R² Score

## ✅ Results

| Model               | MSE (↓) | R² Score (↑) |
|--------------------|---------|--------------|
| Linear Regression  | x.xx    | x.xx         |
| Random Forest      | x.xx    | x.xx         |

> 📌 Replace `x.xx` with your actual output values from the notebook.
